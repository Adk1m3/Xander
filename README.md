Hi, welcome to the Xander Project! <br>
I've just started my game dev journey, this is my first game project.
# The idea & Game Loop
A 2D factory space game for PC & Android. The idea is a simple planet base factory game in which you will have to collect resources, 
exapand the factory, automate and then move to another planet. <br>
**Game Loop:**
- Start a factory on a starter planet
- Collect materials to automate and expand the factory
- Manage resources & defend your factory (Factorio Like)
- Build a rocket and move to another planet
- Research new tecnologies with new materials
- Land on planet carefully
  
**What will i do**:
- All assets in pixel art
- Music & Sound
- Small prototype before lunch all aviable on GitHub
- Playable builds on [itch.io](https://adk1m3.itch.io)
- Optimization for PC and later for Android
